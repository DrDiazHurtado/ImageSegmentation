OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is one of the most popular and widely used packages. Among other functionalities it allows image segmentation, a task
that involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions. The goal of image segmentation is to partition an image into meaningful regions. YOLO (You Only Look Once) provides trained models for object detection in an image.
